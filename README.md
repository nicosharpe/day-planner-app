# day-planner-app

A simple day planner to plan your day by the hour.

This planner app displays the current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner and presents timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Each timeblock is colour-coded based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

The user can enter an event when they click a timeblock and save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock, meaning their plans will still be in the planner after refreshing the page or closing and re-opening the browser.

# Installation

# Usage

To use this planner, simply open the webpage using the link at the top of this readme. You can then see the time and date and the colour coded text areas. Click on the text area for the hour you want to plan for and click save when done, you can now go away and do your tasks and come back to the webpage to see what's next and your text will still be there.

Complete all tasks and repeat tomorrow :)
